to run?
	- drag index.html into browser
What is React?
	- JavaScript library created by Facebook
	- Also used by Netflix & Instagram
	- Used to create JS-driven dynamic web apps
	- In that regard, can be compared to Angular & Vue

What is Redux?
	- A layer on-top of React
	- Helps with state management of our app
		- data in the app
		- UI state of the app
	- Learn this in the 2nd half of the playlist


What we'll learn (hopefully)
	- React basics
		- components, events, templates, props & forms
	- React Router
		- routes, route parameters, redirects
	- Redux
		- stores, actions & reducers
	

Components & Templates
	- Components look like HTML templates (actually JSX)
	- They can contain 'state' (data or UI state)
	- They also can contain JavaScript for functionality


Component State
	- JavaScript Object
	- Describe the current state of the component
		- data, UI-state
	-The state of a component can be updated over time
		- a modal could close 
		- the data we output could change	


Destructuring



Container vs UI Components
	
	Container Components 
		- Contain state
		- Contain lifecycle hooks
		- Not concerned with UI
		- Use classes to create 
	UI Components
		- Don't contain state
		- Receive data from props
		- Only concerned with UI
		- Use functions to create


Redux 
	- Central data store for all app data
	- Any component can access data from it
	- Makes state management easy
